FAQ:1. What is LearnSlice AI-Mentor?A personal chat-based AI mentor for early-career talent that delivers personalized onboarding, continuous upskilling and on-the-job practice. From day one.

 2. Is the content exam-aligned?Yes. The platform recreates realistic IHK and university exam scenarios and maps learning paths to regional IHK requirements.

3. Can we customise training for our company?
Absolutely. Ready-made role simulations are included out-of-the-box, and you can optionally upload internal documents to tailor onboarding, upskilling and lateral-entry (Quereinstieg) scenarios.

4. How does the AI personalise learning? The AI profiles each learner (skills, goals, company needs), creates a bespoke learning plan, and adapts tasks in real time to close knowledge gaps.

5. How is competency proven? Competency is validated continuously with job-relevant checks (quizzes, deep dives and case studies) and realistic simulations — measurable job-readiness, not just completion certificates.

6. What engagement mechanics are included? Built-in gamification: points, badges and levels to boost motivation, focus and completion rates.

7. Is my data safe / GDPR compliant? Yes. 100% GDPR-compliant. Data can be stored on German, European or your company systems per your policy.

8. How does this help reduce dropout and trainer load? Targeted, practice-led learning shortens ramp time, reduces friction and keeps talent engaged,  freeing senior staff to focus on strategic work. The platform is designed to lower dropouts and cut trainer hours.

How does pricing & integration work? Billed annually. Core functionality is included; optional customisation or platform integrations may incur additional costs. Free support is provided.

10. How fast can we get started? Implementation is designed to be quick: out-of-the-box simulations work immediately, and optional company customisation can be rolled in as needed. (Contact us for a tailored onboarding timeline.)
