## Why Enterprise Onboarding and Upskilling Break Down

Modern enterprises struggle to scale learning and knowledge transfer:

- New hires take months to become productive  
- Critical knowledge is locked in senior employees’ heads  
- Training teams can’t provide personal support at scale  
- Generic learning content lacks job relevance  
- High early attrition wastes hiring investments  

**Slow ramp-up means lost productivity and revenue.**
