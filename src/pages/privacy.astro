			<h2>3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Information?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
			<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>

				<li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>4. When And With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em></p>
			<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
				<li><strong>Other Users.</strong> When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your profile.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
			<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
			<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

			<h2>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</em></p>
			<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

			<h2>7. Do We Collect Information From Minors?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
			<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@learnslice.com.</p>
			<p>LearnSlice provides certain Services and Resources which may be used by children. Children are not regarded as fully independent users of the Services and Resources. It is the parents'/guardians' responsibility, respectively, to ensure the use of the LearnSlice Services and Resources is in accordance with the Agreement and to safeguard the children's safety and privacy. Apart from the limitations within the functioning of the Services, LearnSlice has no control over how parents/guardians oversee the children's use of the Services as LearnSlice does not interact directly with the children using the Services and Resources.</p>

			<h2>9. Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
			<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

			<h2>10. Do California Residents Have Specific Privacy Rights?</h2>
			<p><em>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
			<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The Light' law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
