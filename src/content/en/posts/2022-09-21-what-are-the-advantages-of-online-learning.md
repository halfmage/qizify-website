Today we are going to talk about online learning. Even though online courses are risky and sometimes misleading, discovering a site where you can find study material and training tailored to meet your particular needs can be much better than offline courses. So if you are looking for an overview of online learning, then you are in the correct place to keep reading.

## Some outstanding characteristics of online learning include:

### Technology
Technology itself in education provides several benefits, including allowing students to learn through videos, pictures, and audio. It also allows you to gain extensive knowledge about a chosen topic. With the aid of the Internet, an individual can also take live tests and exams.

### Ease of monitoring
It is essential to take notes and keep up with what the instructor says when attending a regular physical class. However, studying online allows you to pause, repeat, and fast-forward lectures at your convenience.

### Performance tracking
In physical classes, you receive feedback from your teacher from time to time. While taking part in an online course, one can check the progress right away after exercises are done or anytime in the learning process. That gives the learner's ability to react faster to their learning progress.

### Great content
Finding good trainers for particular topics is not easy. You may have to travel to their coaching center or home every day to be able to learn the subject well. With online classes, you can learn from the best trainers in the world. You donâ€™t have to go anywhere. You will only have to click the Play button.

### Efficient and cost-effective
Those who have graduated from school or college understand how costly education can be. The cost of online classes is a fraction of what it would be at a physical institute, yet you receive the same quality education.

### Benefits of Online Courses with predefined content:

- Learners choose online courses to be flexible and independent. It is up to you when and where you study.
- Advancement of a career through achievements
- Programs covering a broad range of topics
- More aspects to consider
- Applicable to the job profile coursework
- Better time management
- A wide range of opportunities as learning happens virtually
- Top online courses can help you get the best and most high-paying job.

Some courses offered on online sites can help you gain experience in a small sector with a low salary package, but they are not supposed to give you a paying job either. Thus, first, identify your learning goals and list a few essential courses that will bring you to your target.

While developing LearnSlice platform, we kept in mind all of mentioned above points and integrated them into our learning management system as features, for instance:

- **Relevant content**: First, for us, students must work with relevant content. Who knows better what is the right content for you than you? Thus, on our platform learners and teachers create games as quizzes based on their study material, and share with other learners of their dedicated space.

- **Performance tracking**: Learners can find their key performance indicators on the profile page. This data is, of course, visible to the learner only.

- **Gamification**. According to specialists in the education domain, gamification help learners understand and remember the study material better than while using the classical approaches.
