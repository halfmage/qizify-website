A learning management system (LMS or Lernmanagement-System (in German) is a platform for the execution of e-learning. Choosing the right learning management system is critical not only for learners, but for universities and schools too. Learning takes time, and it is crucial to invest that time efficiently to get the best results. Nowadays, there are many e-learning providers in the market. But how to find the right tool relevant to your learners' content? How about an application to create this content yourself!

The important criteria for educational institutions are:

1. **Security**: Data privacy and infrastructure are essential for the education industry
2. **Reliability**: An accessible platform for both learners and educational institutions alike
3. **Multi-Device**: The LMS needs to have a user-friendly mobile version with a responsive design.
4. **Flexibility**: The team should be able to adapt the tool precisely to the needs of your company
5. **Analytics**: Learners should have the possibility to track their performance and goals.
