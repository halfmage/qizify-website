## 1. Using effective online tools for teaching

Modern technologies influenced the way students find and process information. In 2020, in particular, the nature of studying changed drastically. The majority of universities and schools had to go online to continue the educational process. Due to the rapid advancement of technology, students can now receive high-quality education via the Internet through multiple media and learning-support tools.

New benefits are available to instructors and their institutions with the advent of the online classroom and technology-infused instruction. One of the most noticeable benefits is the possibility of more flexible learning schedules. 

**Teachers can:**

- Have an efficient tracking system that enables them to provide efficient coaching. 
- Use learning management systems to track students' progress through a course. 

**Meanwhile, students can:**

- See how they engaged with the broadcasts and recordings
- Watch lectures live or record videos of lecturers during their delivery

## 2. Boost in soft skills training

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nataliapeart/2019/09/10/the-12-most-important-skills-you-need-to-succeed-at-work/?sh=3507d83f1c6a) reports that collaboration, problem-solving, written communication, and creativity are the most valuable skills at work. Schools must train students to nurture and grow in these skill areas to be ready for their future careers. Additionally, to do so, the educators need to find an appropriate balance between the time students are spending on screens in class and the importance of encouraging them to work together face-to-face. That is how soft skills develop.

The result of this training is the following: 

- Students will be more employable
- Alumni success rates improve
- Future students are looking for schools that have a high alumni graduation rate

## 3. Constant learning

Continuous study is vital for professionals to remain competitive. Professional education in the first half of a career life cannot be considered enough to prepare you for the rest of your career.

**What is needed to succeed in the job?**

- Ongoing learning
- Self-development mindset for students and their faculty staff
- A learning environment fosters students to develop self-learning skills to learn and engage in their chosen career fields.

However, schools that focus on learning these skills can keep in touch with their alumni throughout their lives. For former students to master their fields, educational institutions can offer continuing learning courses to keep them engaged and improve their knowledge.

## 4. Focus on learning than teaching

With the vast supply of information, many students prefer less of a top-down delivery method. Instead, teachers now act as navigators and supporters. They help students uncover and understand information and teach them how to learn.

Teachers face some challenges, as they need to develop soft skills such as leadership and problem-solving. The emphasis is on teamwork and conversations. Teachers will also gain immediate feedback from students as they become more involved in the learning process. [LearnSlice's new model](https://www.learnslice.com/) is particularly rewarding for those who wish to concentrate more on student development than simply knowledge delivery.
